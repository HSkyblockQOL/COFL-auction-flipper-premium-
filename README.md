How are profitable flips found? New flips are found by comparing every new auction with the sell price of already finished auctions of the same item with the same or similar modifiers (e.g. enchantments).

What auctions are new auctions compared with? Reference auctions depend on the individual item, its modifiers, and how often it is sold. The algorithm to determine which auctions can be used as reference is changing frequently. You can see the auctions used for reference by clicking on the (?) next to Estimated Profit

How reliable is the flipper? Statistically very reliable. Still, some flips might not sell as fast as others or at all. If you encounter a flip that can not be sold, please post a link to it in the skyblock channel on our discord so we can improve the flipper further.

What do these labels mean? Cost Cost is the auction price that you would have to pay.

Median Price Median Price is the median price for that item. Taking into account ultimate enchantments, valuable enchantments (eg. snipe 4), price paid at dark auctions, Pet level, Pet item, Reforges, Cake years, Kill counts, Rarity and stars. (basically everything that could change the price)

Volume Volume is the number of auctions that were sold in a 24 hour window. It is capped at 60 to keep the flipper fast.

Lowest bin The lowest bin gives you an indication how much this item type is worth. It displays the lowest price for a given item type and ignores modifiers. You can click it.

Should I flip an item with low volume? If you have to ask this question, the answer probably no. Low volume items require some user expertise to determine if the item actually is a good flip or not. However since its sold so infrequently it may be a niche item that has a higher profit margin.
